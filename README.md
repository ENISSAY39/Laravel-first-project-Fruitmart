## Fruits Page UI

Here is the interface generated by the view `resources/views/Fruits/index.blade.php`.

![Fruits Page](screenshots/fruits_page.png)

### Explanation
- The title is displayed at the top of the page.  
- The fruits list is shown with their **name, price, and ID**.  
- These values are passed from the route defined in `routes/web.php`.  
- The view uses Blade templating (`@foreach`) to loop through the fruits.
